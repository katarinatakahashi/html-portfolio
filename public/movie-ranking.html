<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Legend of Bagger Vance</h3>
<p>I love the theme of "finding your own authentic swing" - your specialty and the ultimate expression of you in the zone.</p>
<h3>The Big Lebowski</h3>
<p>So funny and quotable.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Such a great adaptation to the film format of the classic fantasy series.</p>
